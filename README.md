# Rerun Sample Project
(Documentation WIP)

# Overview

This is a sample project for the [Rerun](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Rerun) module, showcasing how to integrate the Rerun code into a project, using a git submodule.
See module documentation at https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Rerun

# Instructions

When you open up you will likely be asked about entering Safe Mode, you can select Ignore and continue. This error is due to the fact that some required packages are missing from the sample project and must be installed locally.

Read the [Rerun](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Rerun) instructions on required packages and assets.
